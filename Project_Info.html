                <p>
                    We made a project with a ESP 32 board which is combined with the IOT(Internet Of Things). 
                    In this project we are mainly working on the automation for the home appliances or other 
                    appliances to operate them remotely from anywhere. for that we used an free cloud based 
                    software called NGrok which provides a cloud service till our device is in the on condition.
                    If the device get shut down simultaneously cloud service will get stopped. With help of this 
                    Ngrok software & ESP 32 board, we made an 2 led base hardware which we can operate from anywhere. 
                    We also made a html,CSS and java based page to turn off and turn on led via cloud service.
